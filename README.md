#Minesweeper

This is a command line implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. It is written in Ruby, focusing on incapsulation and making each class's API as abstract and high level as I can. My goal was to write this game in a way that could be very quickly and easily understood from the way that the different classes interact with each other.

To play the game, simply download the repo, run bundle install, then run game.rb in the terminal. It may not render well or work at all on non-Mac machines.
